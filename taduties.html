												<div class="card-content">
												 	<p> Trading at par occurs when the bond is being traded at its face value. Since the market interest rates are always fluctuating, a bond can only be at par when interests rates are at its coupon rate, which can be a rarety. This has occurred before in our course when we were studying bond economics. For example, if a bond is being issued at 8% and the market interest rate when it is being sold is 8% also, then it is being traded at par.

If a bid protest is not resolved until after the work has begun, then the protesting bidder will most likely not get the contract but may be compensated for bid preparation and submittal costs.  Example (from book): Contractors needed to be prequalified to submit bids on a project.  Two contractors were prequalified, but then decided they wanted to bid as a joint venture.  Owner said no, and a protest was issued by the two contractors.  The protest was resolved and the two contractors were allowed to submit a bid as a joint venture.

After collecting competitive bids from several underwriters, the issuer awards the contract to the underwriter with the lowest, responsible price and contract terms. Competitive bidding aims at obtaining goods and services at the lowest prices by stimulating competition, and by preventing favoritism. An example of a competitive bid is when a government building project is started and a qualified construction company submits an offer to do it for a certain price.

												 	<p> a contract performed almost entirely on the owner's funds. The owner periodically reimburses the provider as they incur costs in providing the contracted services. The payments received from the owner are directly dependent on the costs incurred. In construction management these types of contracts are fairly common between owners and A/Es or owners and CMs because they shift much of the risk to owners allowing for lower contractor bids. Anytime firm pricing is not easily determined, this is a way in which owners may opt to conduct business.

												 	<p> The Davis-Bacon Act is a US federal law that required employers to pay the local prevailing wages for laborers and mechanics in any construction, alteration, or repair of public buildings or public works. The Davis–Bacon act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Herbert Hoover on March 3, 1931 and has been amended several times since. It covers the 4 main areas of construction. The Wage and Hour Division of the US Dept. of Labor is responsible for collecting the prevailing wage data and disseminating it. The Davis-Bacon Act is prevalent in any form of construction work done in the public sector. Contractors have to account for its provisions in their cost estimates and bids anytime they enter public projects, or ones even partially funded by government, this includes any type of roadwork, military facilities, or public buildings.

												<div class="card-content">
												 	<p> 
A way to allocate the decreasing cost of a tangible asset over the course of its useful life. Example: Tractors are considered 3-year properties, and follow the straight-line depreciation method. If I purchase a tractor that costs $6000, assuming it has no salvage value, for the next 3 years, my annual depreciation charge will be $2000, and the book value of the tractor decreases by $2000 each year. This depreciation charge is also deducted from my taxable income, reducing the amount of tax I need to pay

												<p> Depreciation allowance (or charge) </p>

											<div class="face back">
												<div class="card-content">
												 	<p> An amount deducted from gross income in one's tax return to compensate for the depreciation of a property. This is one of the adjustments that is made to determine one's taxable income.  It is calculated based on the original cost of the property, and is often a fixed percentage of that cost. Example: A $6000 tractor with no salvage value (3-year straight line depreciation) will result in a depreciation charge of $2000 a year for the next 3 years. This means that the book value of the tractor decreases by $2000 a year, while my taxable income decreases by $2000 a year, resulting in me paying less taxes.
