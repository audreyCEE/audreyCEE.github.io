												<div class="card-content">
												 	<p> Trading at par occurs when the bond is being traded at its face value. Since the market interest rates are always fluctuating, a bond can only be at par when interests rates are at its coupon rate, which can be a rarety. This has occurred before in our course when we were studying bond economics. For example, if a bond is being issued at 8% and the market interest rate when it is being sold is 8% also, then it is being traded at par.

If a bid protest is not resolved until after the work has begun, then the protesting bidder will most likely not get the contract but may be compensated for bid preparation and submittal costs.  Example (from book): Contractors needed to be prequalified to submit bids on a project.  Two contractors were prequalified, but then decided they wanted to bid as a joint venture.  Owner said no, and a protest was issued by the two contractors.  The protest was resolved and the two contractors were allowed to submit a bid as a joint venture.

The Wage and Hour Division of the US Dept. of Labor is responsible for collecting the prevailing wage data and disseminating it. The Davis-Bacon Act is prevalent in any form of construction work done in the public sector. Contractors have to account for its provisions in their cost estimates and bids anytime they enter public projects, or ones even partially funded by government, this includes any type of roadwork, military facilities, or public buildings.

Alternately, the owner may include an escalation provision to relieve the contractor of the additional costs due to escalation, if escalation were to occur.

												 	<p> The general definition of estimating is to approximate or roughly calculate the value of something. In this class, the term 'estimating' would be used on almost every engineering project possible. For example, in construction, there are design, bid, and control estimates. Design estimates cover detailed estimates regarding the project from the engineer/designer to the owner. Bid estimates are what a contractor will present to an owner (or maybe from a subcontractor to a GC) as their price for how much the project will cost including overhead and profit. Control estimates are a separate estimation that is used to track finances once a project has been contracted out.
