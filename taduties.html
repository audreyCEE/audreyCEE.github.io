												<div class="card-content">
												 	<p> Trading at par occurs when the bond is being traded at its face value. Since the market interest rates are always fluctuating, a bond can only be at par when interests rates are at its coupon rate, which can be a rarety. This has occurred before in our course when we were studying bond economics. For example, if a bond is being issued at 8% and the market interest rate when it is being sold is 8% also, then it is being traded at par.

If a bid protest is not resolved until after the work has begun, then the protesting bidder will most likely not get the contract but may be compensated for bid preparation and submittal costs.  Example (from book): Contractors needed to be prequalified to submit bids on a project.  Two contractors were prequalified, but then decided they wanted to bid as a joint venture.  Owner said no, and a protest was issued by the two contractors.  The protest was resolved and the two contractors were allowed to submit a bid as a joint venture.

The Wage and Hour Division of the US Dept. of Labor is responsible for collecting the prevailing wage data and disseminating it. The Davis-Bacon Act is prevalent in any form of construction work done in the public sector. Contractors have to account for its provisions in their cost estimates and bids anytime they enter public projects, or ones even partially funded by government, this includes any type of roadwork, military facilities, or public buildings.

												 	<p> The general definition of estimating is to approximate or roughly calculate the value of something. In this class, the term 'estimating' would be used on almost every engineering project possible. For example, in construction, there are design, bid, and control estimates. Design estimates cover detailed estimates regarding the project from the engineer/designer to the owner. Bid estimates are what a contractor will present to an owner (or maybe from a subcontractor to a GC) as their price for how much the project will cost including overhead and profit. Control estimates are a separate estimation that is used to track finances once a project has been contracted out.

												 	<p> The Miller Act requires that, before any contract exceeding $100,000 is awarded for the construction, alteration or repair of any building or public work of the US, the construction contractor must furnish a payment bond and a performance bond. The Miller Act has successfully protected the interests of the federal government, taxpayers, and subcontractors and suppliers by ensuring that construction contractors are qualified to perform their contractual obligations to the government, that precious taxpayer funds are protected through third-party guarantees of contract performance and payment, and that subcontractors and suppliers have a payment remedy in the event the prime contractor becomes insolvent or fails to pay them. Therefore, Miller Act bond requirements ensure that, when the federal government seeks to procure construction, it will select from a pool of contractors qualified to perform the project.

												 	<p>Multiple prime contracts: A contract used when one or more constructors are employed under separate contracts to perform work on the same project, either in a sequence or coincidentally.   Example in context of this course : ( page 20 Bartholomew) Suppose that a plumbing contractor A and an electrical contractor B each contract directly under a common owner C, on the same project, requiring both A and B to be on the site simultaneously. If the owner does not explicitly mention third party beneficiary clauses in either of the contracts, and Contractor A ends up damaging Contractor B, Contractor B would have no right of recovery directly against Contractor A.        Multiple Prime Contracts are a good way for an owner to pass on liability to the contractors if he/she inserts similar clauses into their contracts such as if one prime contractor damages any of the others, their only recourse is to seek recovery from the contractor(s) who caused the damage.

The purpose of the predesign phase is to lay out the purpose and the feasbility of the project early on since the earlier you catch a critical flaw in the project, the less you lose money. An example is from the University of California. According to their facilities manual, predesign phases include Design Professional Services, Project Program (scope, budget, user function, square footage), Review of Conceptual Design (going over issues with interested parties), and Preliminary Evaluation (feasibility analyses).

												 	<p> Risk has a dictionary definition of “exposure to danger, harm, or loss.” Risk can come from anything (i.e. geographic location, social climate, weather, political conflict, disease, economic stability, competition, etc.). Some of these sources of risk may be predicted, allowing an accurately calculated financial cushion to accounted for any potential loss. Some contracts may even involve a specified financial cushion or a specific contractual agreement that take unforeseen risk into account. Risk is a major factor in both bidding a contract and speculating/developing a project.

												<div class="card-content">
												 	<p> Shift work is, by definition, "work comprising recurring periods in which different groups of workers do the same jobs in rotation" (Google). The intention of shift work is to use all 24 hours in a day to perform work. This can dramatically shorten a project schedule but also add significant cost since off-hour work costs more and typically has lower productivity. Shift work is also often frowned upon due to the health effects it can have on the laborers. There are three types of shifts: day shift, swing shift, and graveyard shift. Day shift occurs during normal working hours, swing shift occurs from mid afternoon to around midnight, and graveyard shift is from midnight to 8 AM. Construction projects that have very critical schedules will choose to complete the work through "shift work." This is jointly decided with the owner typically since it increases the cost of the project. However, it is chosen when there is a strict deadline to begin user functions and moving that deadline would cost more than not adding shifts.

												 	<p> Staging of work is a plan that outlines spacially and logistically how the project site will function. This plan will cover where each major area will be, where the access points are to go in and out of site, and what the emergency procedures are. This is a safety requirement as the staging plan typically also covers hazards presented by the site and how those hazards will be mitigated. The plan must be extremely detailed covering topics such as walkways, barriers, fences, fall protection, protection, knox box (key for firemen), dumpster, cranes, hoists, bathrooms, and so much more. It is a critical and absolutely necessary plan for every project in construction especially since construction has a high safety risk. This allows a project to run more smoothly and to keep people informed on how to move around site while minimizing risk.

For example, if you were purchasing a machine which depreciated $100,000 at an accelerated rate over the course of 3 years, you would calculate the depreciation at the beginning of the first year as 3/6*$100,000 because it has 3 years of life remaining, and the sum-of-year-digits is 3+2+1=6.

												 	<p> A bond guarantees the performance of a contract or other obligation. Surety bonds are 3 party instruments by which 1 party (surety) guarantees or promises a 2nd party (obligee) the successful performance of a 3rd party (principal). The Surety, which is a financial institution possessing great wealth and stability, determines if an applicant (principal) is qualified to be bonded for the performance of some act or service. If the bonded individual does not perform as promised, the surety performs the obligation or pays for any damages. The purpose of a surety is to protect public and private interests against financial loss. For example, if Joe is the principal and has promised someone (obligee) that he will do something, and Joe fails to perform, financial loss could result to the obligee. The obgliee could say to Joe, “If you can be bonded, I’ll accept your performance promise.” Joe then goes to a surety and asks to be bonded. If the surety determines that Joe is qualified and will live up to his promise, it will just the bond and charge Joe a “premium” for putting its name behind Joe’s promise. Joe is still responsible to perform as promised. The surety is responsible only in the event that Joe does not fulfill his promises.
